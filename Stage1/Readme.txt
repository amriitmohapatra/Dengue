To execute Stage 1, i.e. forecasting cases at the aggregate level, source Stage1.R file. 

When running Stage1.R, the code will ask to enter the user directory.
Paste the directory path where the Stage1 folder is located.
It should look something like this: "C:\\username\...\Dengue\Stage1"

Before adding the start and end dates for the training and test sets, please check
the time periods of the data available. Please remember the dates as they will be needed when running Stage 2. 

For the animation plot done using python, i.e. "Figure1Video.py", the file should be run only after "Figure1_Supplementary.R" is executed.
